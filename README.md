# quiz3_api

 This mini project was a quiz for my python course in University. For this project I used Pixabay API, 
which is an API to get random images, you can even adjust the amount of pictures and the theme of them.

 When you run the project you will be able to input what kind of images you'd like to see and based on
that information you will get 3 images added to your python package, as well as a new json file describing
these pictures. it will also print the first image's id, views, downloads and likes, create a table and add 
this information into that table.
